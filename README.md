# 🌐 Terraform Migrate and Refresh

This project demonstrates how to migrate existing (manually created) infrastructure into Terraform and use the `terraform refresh` command to sync the Terraform state with real-world infrastructure.

---

## 📋 Overview

When infrastructure is created outside of Terraform (e.g., via cloud console or CLI), it can be brought under Terraform management using:

1. `terraform import` – to bring real-world resources into Terraform state.
2. `terraform refresh` – to update the state file with actual values from the infrastructure.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v1.1 or higher
- Cloud credentials set up (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Access to existing infrastructure you want to manage
